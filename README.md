## Project Setup

### Setting up a new project
- `git clone git@github.com:atomicrobot/Carbon-Android.git`
- `cd Carbon-Android`
- Download Python if needed https://www.python.org/downloads/
- `python renamePackage.py com.demo.mobile`
- (optional) Rename the project directory from `Carbon-Android` to something meaningful.
- (optional) Add a git remote to the project (a clean repository has been setup for you).
- (optional) Adding a new activity: `./gradlew app:screen -Ppackage=com.demo.mobile -Pscreen=SignIn`

### First Run
- When you open up a project for the first time, if you get a "Please specify Android SDK" message when trying to run the app then you need to run a Gradle Sync from Android Studio.

### Crashlytics
To register an app to an organization you will need to go to the Crashlytics web dashboard, go to
the organization settings, and then get the keys and secrets it displays.
- Update `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` with the organization api key.

### Signing configs
*DO NOT* use the demo keystore in your apps.

- Note: If you are creating signing keys, consider setting up Google Play App Signing (https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html#google-play-app-signing)
- Run `distribution/keys/generateKey.sh release` and update `app/build.gradle` signing configs appropriately.

## Quality

### Automated Checks
- Unit tests - `./gradlew allChecks`

## Gradle and plugins

To see what the dependency tree currently looks like:
- `./gradlew app:dependencies`

To see what dependencies might be out of date:
- `./gradlew app:dependencyUpdates -Drevision=release`
- Note: This has been hit and miss lately. You can also check Lint for obsolete dependency warnings.

## Continuous Integration Setup

These are written in the context of a TeamCity CI setup.

## Jacoco Test Report
  - `./gradlew clean jacocoTestReport`
  - To view report go to <ProjectDir>/build/reports/jacoco/jacocoTestReport/html/index.html

### Gradle tasks
This will pull in the current Git SHA and auto incrementing build number as part of the build.

`continuousIntegration -Pfingerprint=%build.vcs.number% -PbuildNumber=%build.counter% -PdisablePreDex`

Also make sure the CI server is set to use the Gradle wrapper.
